# 🌐 Lifecoin — A Human-Centric Cryptocurrency

**Created by:** morfeusm  
**Date of origin:** July 2025

---

## 💡 Concept Overview

Lifecoin is a radically ethical cryptocurrency that embodies equality by anchoring its supply directly to the verified global population.  
Its founding principle is simple:  
**1 verified human = 1 Lifecoin**

Lifecoin is designed to resist accumulation, prevent wealth inequality, and foster community value through a unique **rental-only model** — no buying or selling of ownership.

---

## 🔑 Core Features

- **Limited Supply**: Total number of Lifecoins is tied to the number of living, verified people on Earth.
- **Equal Ownership**: No individual can own more than one Lifecoin, secured via proof-of-personhood.
- **Fractional Renting**: Each Lifecoin can be split into **10 blocks**, which may be temporarily rented out in exchange for services, favors, or collaboration.
- **Automatic Return**: All blocks return to the original owner after a set time or fulfillment of agreed terms. Ownership never transfers.
- **Non-Speculative System**: Blocks may not be sold or traded permanently, eliminating financial speculation.

## ⚖️ Goals & Philosophy

- Promote **digital dignity**: Each human deserves an equal stake.
- Reduce **inequality**: Prevent accumulation of crypto wealth among elites.
- Encourage **collaboration over consumption**: Renting encourages meaningful exchange.
- Enable **ethical smart contracts**: A reputation system may support value assessment for rentals.

## 🧪 Technical Vision

### 🔹 Proof-of-Personhood
Lifecoin depends on a decentralized and privacy-preserving system to verify unique humans — without compromising anonymity.

### 🔹 Blockchain Implementation
- Lifecoin can be built on a standalone chain or as a token (ERC-20, Substrate, etc.).
- Smart contracts handle:
  - Identity binding
  - Rental terms
  - Automated block return
